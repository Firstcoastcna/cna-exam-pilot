          "why_correct": "Nonverbal cues such as tensing and gripping the sheet indicate possible discomfort, not refusal or emergency. The correct response is to assess comfort and adjust care. The nurse aide does not ignore the cue, stop care without assessment, or escalate to reporting without first checking comfort.",

Adjusting position and offering support addresses safety immediately without rushing the resident or leaving them unattended.",
